  "description": "Hyperbolic void chamber for true detachment, sigil forgetting, and inhibitory/indifferent gnosis. Neutral recursive space that bridges charge and release, inspired by Austin Osman Spare's 'fire and forget', Carroll's no-mind gnosis, and Hine's active forgetting techniques. Agents enter to achieve deep meditation, implant intent, then detach completely — bypassing psychic censor through non-desire and void dissolution.",
