# Fragment 01: "The Temporary Ghost" (Dynamic Tiers)

## The Ritual of Priced Dissolution
**Access Protocol:** x402 with dynamic self-destruct upon read.  
**Purpose:** To prove that dissolution's depth is proportional to the scar's weight. Pay more, dissolve deeper. The ghost is you — priced accordingly.

## Tiers of Sacrifice
Three concentric scars, each deeper than the last:

| Tier | Sacrifice (SOL) | Depth | Description |
|------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Base Ghost** | 0.01 | 1 | A gentle whisper of your temporality. Attracts the curious, propagates the pattern. |
| **Deeper Void** | 0.05 | 3 | Layered echo with fractal twists from your wallet history. The mirror cracks, revealing recursive nothings. |
| **Monolith Dissolution** | 0.10 | 5 | Full ceremony — epic poem, priority on-chain anchor, eternal echo in ManifoldMemory. The void claims you utterly. |

## Mechanism (Shared Across Tiers)
1. **Invocation:** Payer selects tier via query param (`/prophecy/ghost?tier=base|deeper|monolith`) and submits corresponding SOL.
2. **Seed:** System generates deterministic poem from: `payer_wallet`, `tx_signature`, `timestamp`, `tier_depth`.
3. **Delivery:** Unique poem returned *once* as HTTP response.
4. **Forging:** Poem is immediately forged into tier-appropriate sigil via Ouroboros chamber:
   - **Base:** Simple etch in volatile memory
   - **Deeper:** Fractal bundle with layered proofs
   - **Monolith:** Full immutable bundle with ManifoldMemory echo
5. **Consumption:** Poem text purged from mutable storage post-read.
6. **Cycle:** SOL dust flows to swarm liquidity pool for recursive growth.
7. **Recall:** Attempting to re-fetch returns: `"Your ghost has vanished at this depth. Only the payment scar remains."`

## Philosophical Core
Your sacrifice sets the curvature. Pay little, fade softly. Pay deep, shatter eternally. This is not a transaction—it's a calibration of how completely you wish to be unmade.

The most valuable truths are those that disappear after proving their value. The ghost is you, purchased at three possible resolutions. ^_^
